## Core Features

### 👤 User & Authentication

- **JWT Authentication:** Secure user registration and login using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Redis Token Blacklisting:** Implemented a secure logout feature by blacklisting expired tokens in Redis.
- **Role-Based Access Control:**
  - **Resident:** Can report, view, and comment on issues.
  - **Community Admin:** Can manage community settings, users, and issue statuses.
  - **Super Admin:** Can manage all communities and users across the platform.

### 🏢 Community & Tenancy

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** The platform is built to serve multiple communities from a single backend, with data strictly isolated by community.
- **Admin Dashboards:** Dedicated dashboards for both Community Admins (user management, settings) and Super Admins (platform stats, global user/community management).
- **Community Settings:** Admins can configure issue categories, AI features, and other community-specific settings.

### 📋 Issue Management

- **Full CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update, and manage community issues.
- **Image Uploads:** Users can attach multiple images to issue reports, which are hosted via Cloudinary.
- **Advanced Filtering & Sorting:** Filter issues by status, category, urgency, or search query. Sort by creation date or upvote count.
- **Engagement:** Users can upvote issues and participate in nested comment threads.

### 🤖 AI Integration (via Google Gemini)

- **AI Analysis:** Issue drafts receive category, sentiment, summary, and tag suggestions while the user writes. AI never overrides the user's final category.
- **AI Admin Assist:** Admins can generate an AI-powered reply to comments based on the issue's current status and context.
- **Admin Category Editing:** Community and super admins can change an issue category through an explicit Edit and Save workflow.

### ⚡ Real-Time Features (Socket.io)

- **Live Notifications:** Users receive real-time notifications for status updates and new comments on their issues.
- **Live Issue Updates:** Issue details (like upvotes and new comments) update live for all users viewing the page without a refresh.
- **Real-time Dashboard:** (Future) Dashboards can be configured to update live as new issues are posted.

## 🚀 Getting Started Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (or a free MongoDB Atlas account)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) (or use the Docker one-liner: `docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis`)

### 1. Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aryanwebx/Project-Pulse-.git
    cd Project-Pulse-
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the backend:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Create `.env` file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the `backend` directory and add the following variables:

    ```env
    # Copy backend/.env.example and replace the placeholder values.
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
    CLOUDINARY_URL=your_cloudinary_url
    CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=8000
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key
    REDIS_URL=redis://default:password@host:port
    ```

5.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The backend API will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend:**
    Open a new terminal and go to the `frontend` directory from the root.

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create `.env` file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the `frontend` directory and add the API URL:

    ```env
    # Copy frontend/.env.example and replace the backend URL when deployed.
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
    ```

4.  **Run the frontend app:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Backend checks

Run the backend syntax smoke test from the `backend` directory:

## ☁️ Deployment

This application is deployed with a decoupled, serverless-friendly architecture:

- **Frontend:** The React/Vite app is deployed as a **Static Site** on **Vercel**.
- **Backend:** The Node.js/Express API is deployed as a **Web Service** on **Render**.
- **Database:** A managed **MongoDB Atlas** cluster is used for the database.
- **Cache:** A managed **Redis Cloud** instance is used for token blacklisting.

For deployment, configure the backend environment variables from `backend/.env.example` and set `CLIENT_URL` to the deployed frontend URL. Configure the frontend `VITE_API_URL` to the deployed backend URL. Never commit `.env` files or secret values.
